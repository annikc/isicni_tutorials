# Tutorial for IBRO-Simons Computational Neuroscience Imbizo 2022
This tutorial is to lay out the major concepts of reinforcement learning 
and to offer some small practical exercises for testing intuition. 

The tutorial covers the following: 
- Markov Decision Processes (MDPs)
- Environments, specifying transition/reward functions
- Agents (basic model-free, value-based agents)
