# Tutorial for IBRO-Simons Computational Neuroscience Imbizo 2022
This tutorial is to lay out the major concepts of reinforcement learning 
and to offer some small practical exercises for testing intuition. 

The tutorial covers the following: 
- Markov Decision Processes (MDPs)
- Environments, specifying transition/reward functions
- Agents (basic model-free, value-based agents)

Exercises are in general small segments code to be completed within pre-written functions. 
There are some exercises that involve full code to be left to the reader. 
Solutions for this code are available in the `RL_tut_solutions.ipynb` notebook.
